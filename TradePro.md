## Version
1.2.0 for Paper 1.21.10

## Justification
TradePro is needed to add a safe trading system to the server to prevent scamming between players. The plugin provides:

- **Secure Trading Interface**: Players can trade items safely through a GUI-based system where both parties must confirm the trade
- **Scam Prevention**: Eliminates the risk of players taking items without giving what they promised in return
- **Trade Confirmation**: Both players must explicitly accept the trade before items are exchanged
- **Trade History**: Keeps logs of trades for server administration and dispute resolution
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive interface that makes trading between players easy and trustworthy

This addresses the issue of player scamming by providing a structured, safe environment for item exchanges on the server.

## Geyser Compatibility
TradePro is compatible with Geyser and works for Bedrock Edition players. The plugin uses standard Minecraft inventory GUIs which Geyser translates properly for Bedrock clients, allowing both Java and Bedrock players to use the trading system seamlessly.
